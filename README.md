#cpp code analyzer

This is a fairly simple program for finding vulnerabilities in the form of unsafe functions in the source code.


## Functions that are checked:
- **strcpy()**
- **gets()**
- **sprintf()**
- **system()**
- **malloc()**
- **new**


## Test files included!

1. 'test.cpp' - source file with vulnerable code.
2. 'test1.cpp' - another source file with vulnerable code.

## vulnerabilities in test files commented. 

program run example:

./main.exe <filename.cpp>
